# Box Model

Box model refers to how an element is structured. An element is made up of the content, padding, border and margin. These properties can be changed with css to alter the layout and styling of an element and how they work with other elements on a page.

Border and padding are used to style the element itself, while margin is used to define the space between and around elements on a page.
